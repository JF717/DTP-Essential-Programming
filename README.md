# DTP-Essential-Programming
Course material for the DTP essential programming week.


Required packages

Numpy

Scipy

Pandas

matplotlib


By the end of this course you should be comfortable with building your own functions that use loops and logical statements, as well as using pandas and matplotlib to control and visualise data. Once you have completed the practicals there is a final problem with no code provided.

 

We dealt with various financial functions as a teaching mechanism and you will build one final one.


Build a function that calculates pensions. A pension is a pot of savings that you plan to withdraw from when you retire. You add some of your income each month or year to the pot which accumulates interest. When you retire you begin to take money out of it. Your function or functions should calculate your pot over time and the pot size at retirement. It should then tell you how big a pension you could draw and for how long. Visualise the data and save it as a csv.

You may have also improved your battleship game already but the end goal is to have one that is a series of functions that set up the board, the ships and then play it. If possible make it playable by two players.
